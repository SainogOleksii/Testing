Moydodyr
A blanket
I ran away,
A sheet has flown away,
And a pillow,
Like a frog,
She jumped away from me.
I'm for the candle,
Candle - in the stove!
I'm for a book,
That - to escape
And skipping
Under the bed!
I want to get drunk tea,
I run to the samovar,
A pot-bellied from me,
He ran away, as if from a fire.
